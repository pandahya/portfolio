                    Every year, the Design & Technology department at Parsons organizes a series of events to celebrate and showcase the graduating students and thesis projects of that year (BFA + MFA). The events are organized by comittees made up of students in the graduating class and a faculty advisor, and include a pop up show, screening, symposium, reader/publication, and website.
                    <br>
                    I participated as a lead member of the website comittee, responsible for designing the website that would showcase all graduating students & projects based on brand guidelines the branding comittee created. The website copy was written by the promotion comittee and publication comittee. I was in charge of the landing+home, reader, and acknowledgement pages, as well as detailing microinteractions and decorative elements.

                    The first step we took was to look at the <a href="https://parsons.edu/dt-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020</a>, <a href="https://parsons.edu/dt-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021</a>, and <a href="https://parsons.edu/dt-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022</a> Parsons DT websites to further understand what this content would look like and how it was displayed in the past. From these past years' websites, we worked out what we felt worked and didn't work, and in turn how we might want to organize the information.

                    We recieved a very simple brand sheet and a poster design from the brand team. We interpreted the poster composition as the intended arrangement and use of the design elements and tried not to deviate too far from it in our website design.

                    We further detailed some style and use guidelines for the website team to refer to in order to establish even clearer consistency between designs. The final version included detailed components and microinteractions for the developer as well.

                    The pre-launch landing page would be a single page that would be available to view before the website officially launched. Only event information needed to be included. We wanted to minimize unnecessary work, so we maintained the same design for both the pre-launch landing and (post-launch) home page, only adding the nav bar to the latter.

                    I tried to mimic the composition of the poster on the home page and added unique interactions to each element to convey the idea of 'entropy'. The 'entropy' letters would be draggable, the circles would change border type on hover, and the sticks would rotate when moused over.

                    The Entropy Reader, a collection of all publication pieces written by students, would live on the website as a separate section. I worked closely with the publication comittee to determine how information would be best laid out. The publication comittee expressed that they really liked the <a href="https://parsons.edu/dt-2020/publication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 website</a> and requested I do something similar. They also asked for a white background for text legibility since the rest of the website is black.

                <p>
                    I used a gaussian blur + dissolve effect in Photoshop that was applied to the 'entropy' display letters to create a more natural transition between the black and white. And instead of pure white, I used a mix of the neon green and white to create a slight tint that would be easier on the eyes. I also used an alternate arrangement of the 'entropy' letters to better fit the space and signal a separate section.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I found that that the page text and nav bar text overlapping when scrolled was quite unattractive, and decided to include a slight gradient under the nav bar. I added this to every page design, and the color of the gradient would be the same color as that page's background. I additionally made a CodePen with a possible JS solution to applying this gradient as it was not supposed to cover any of the header sections on each page.
