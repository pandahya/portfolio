            A website for the creative studio I'm a member of.

        <h2 id="develop-your-idea">Develop Your Idea</h2>
        <p>
            his is a website for a game/interactive studio my friends and I are starting, called Studio Degen. The website would act as an advertisement/display of the projects we're making and of our team. I want the website to be more subtle, to display the projects themselves, but still be reflective of the ideas and concepts we're working into our games via interesting interactive elements on the pages with less busy content.
        </p>

        <h2 id="discovery-research">Discovery & Research</h2>
        <p>
            A lot of indie game studio websites are very similar looking, and rather static and simple, so we ended up looking more at designers' portfolio sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://richardmattka.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">→ Richard Mattka</a>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Richard Mattka's site has this interactive 3D element on the opening page that's pretty fun, looks good, and doesn't affect the actual content of his work, which are all good points we want. And the way he's displayed his works is quite simple as well, the globe is what really makes the site I'd say.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://sokpop.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">→ sokpop</a>

            <img src="../imgs/sokpop.png">
        </figure>
        <p>
            I really like the non-standard display of this site, with the bubbles, and the playfulness/interactiveness of everything. It has a lot of personality that fits super well with the types of games they make. Though, the presentation of the games isn't the best at showing them fully, as I'd like to have on our site.
        </p>

        <p>
            This site again has this interactive 3D element on the opening page, in addition to a single page scrolling situation and a lot of other details that make the experience really nice. I definetely want to add cursor and scrolling stuffs on our site.
        </p>

        <p>
            There's a lot on this site that's really nice, that we want to emulate as well. We are looking for some kind of single unique interaction or transition to have for our site. I think even just the red hero with the drag to change image plus ripple effect plus particle thing is really fun, and more in the direction we're wanting to do in terms of level of interaction.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            This is the website for the Comp Form class here at Parsons, taught by Justin Bakse (he did the site). I really like all the unique mouse interactions happening in the background of each page (with the canvas element via p5.js), especially this flocking situation. He separates the busy interactions and actual content nicely, and we're wanting to include something similar with flocking to mouse on our site as well.

        <h2 id="target-your-audience">Target Your Audience</h2>
        <p>
            My target audience is:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    people who enjoy games and/or interactive experiences and want more beyond a fun/engaging experience
                </li>
                <li>
                    people interested in quantum, quantum computing, and the atypical applications
                </li>
                <li>
                    those looking to get into or are already in the creative tech field (and related fields)
                </li>
                <li>
                    people who enjoy fun website experiences, people who have been on the internet and know what they're doing, probabaly under 30 years old
                </li>
                <li>
                    future employers and possibly those we're looking for a grant from
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Persona: Ian Cheng</strong>
            <br>
            Ian works in software development and is interested in interactive experiences, especially those that involve a narrative of technology. Ian always enjoyed creative activities but ended up going the more technical route. His creative side is left for activities outside of work, in games and things. Looking for new games to play, he finds one of ours, enjoys the juxtaposition of technological concepts and playfulness, and is interested in seeing what other work we have, and what else he could play. Going to our website, he has a fun time with all the interactivity and is also able to see more about the kinds of cool things people (we) are doing in the creative tech space.

        <h2 id="inspiration-concepts">Inspiration & Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            Our brand personality is:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>creative, youthful, assured, playful</li>
                <li>unexpected, atypical, cultist, niche, evocative</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Our purpose is: to make creative exploratory projects in the hope to engage audiences into sciency stuff. 
            <br>
            Our positioning statement: Studio Degen is the only <span class="underline">creative studio</span> that <span class="underline">brings forth playful and unexpected experiences</span> because we believe that <span class="underline">everyone should have the opportunity to engage with emerging technologies.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Visually, the website is going in the direction of nature x tech. We're wanting to organic shapes and elements from nature like frogs and bugs while still being recognizably tech related.
            <br>
            Our name "Studio Degen" originated in us having terrible sleep schedules and extreme grinding during our first project (<a href="https://studio-degen.github.io/q-sweeper/" target="_blank
        " rel="noopener noreeferrerr">q-sweeper</a>), so we want our overall mood to be something with chaos, but in a controlled manner: controlled chaos? 
            <br>
            All our interactions and fun happenings should be relating to and bringing together these two concepts we have.
