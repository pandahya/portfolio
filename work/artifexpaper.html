            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The Artifex is a game about discovery, exploration, and mystery, exploring how objects, specifically trash, can be used to tell a story. You play as a researcher working for a professor at a university, tasked with inspecting waste and artifacts from ruined lands. The player’s goal is to uncover lost or obscured narratives through the examination of these discovered artifacts, things that have been left behind.

            <h3>What is trash? Why is trash?</h3>
            <p>
                Often overlooked and considered as something gross, trash, waste, garbage, remains, leftovers—whatever you want to call it—is actually a lot more interesting than one would think. Rather than a type of object, “trash” can be more accurately thought of as a description of the state of an object. Before becoming “trash”, things always embody a different identity. And so instead of thinking about trash as just “trash”, trash becomes something that’s no longer wanted or needed, something that’s been left behind, discarded or removed. In telling a story, whats’s not there is just as important as what is. This isn’t a new concept or perspective. Garbage and remains are key components in the work of archaeologists, acting as important tools for understanding how people lived and how societies functioned.
            </p>
            <p>I started off with just one thought. “I like trash”. My first goal was to figure out what to do with that. Throughout the entirety of the the first semester, I dedicated myself to finding a resolution for this. I ended up meandering around quite a bit.</p>

            <p>With little substantial Unity game dev experience under my belt, I'm not sure what gave me the confidence to take on this project.</p>
