                    The theme of the game jam was OUT OF CONTROL. We took the angle of <span class="italics">lack of control/power</span> and correlated that to the issue of deforestation: people can cut down trees faster than they can grow, and there's really nothing trees can do to stop us. The game is played from the perspective of the trees with human NPCs as the enemies. The number of humans coming to cut the trees down increases faster than you can plant new ones. Your goal is to last as long as you can, but all games inevitably end in failure, conveying our interpretation of the theme.
